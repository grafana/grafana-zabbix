#### Max data points
Override max data points, automatically set to graph width in pixels. Grafana-Zabbix plugin uses maxDataPoints parameter to consolidate the real number of values down to this number. If there are more real values, then by default they will be consolidated using averages. This could hide real peaks and max values in your series. Point consolidation will affect series legend values (min,max,total,current).
